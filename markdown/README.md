# Headings
Headings are created by using "\#"s. The number of Hashtags represents the size - with less is more.<br/>
So where `###### Heading` is actually a pretty small heading:
###### Heading
A `### Heading` is way bigger:
### Heading
The range goes from one # to six #######. With one being the largest and six the smallest <small>(Which is caused by H1 - H6 in HTML)</small>.

Heading 1 and 2 may also get created by a different style:
```html
Heading 1
===         
<!-- These dont need to be the same length as the title but must be at least 3 characters long! -->

Heading 2
---------
```
Heading 1
===

Heading 2
---------

# Emphasis/Text Highlighting
You might want to add some \*\***bold**\*\* or \**italic*\* text to your Markdown-Files.<br>
You can use *s aswell as _s, the output is the same:<br>
```
This text is a _random_ **Text** that is using both *italic* and __bold__ highlighting.
There can be ***italic*** and ___bold___ for the same *phrasis __aswell__*.
But if you use these highlights, make sure to use just _one_ for **each**, or to just *stick* with **one.**
It will make **_your_ life** way easier.
